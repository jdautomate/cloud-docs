The private corporate Network is not treated as a trusted Network when accessing critical applications. For access to those services, the User needs to connect to the WPC even if they are on-site.

After authentication, only authorized Users are provided access to the application. This strict zero-trust access policy along with the additional layer of web application authentication by the finance application makes for a strong access security model."},

One of these subnets, named ‘critical app subnet,’ is dedicated to Network together application server infrastructure for internal use by select groups of employees.
