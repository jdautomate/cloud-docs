DNS-based filtering lets you block domain name resolutions for those websites that fall into undesirable or unsafe categories. Specific domain names can be added to allow and block lists. Cyber Shield provides data reporting on the number of observed and blocked domain name queries originating from your Users.

Once presented with statistics on the type of traffic detected and the number of times that type of traffic was detected, you can drill down and investigate exactly which User-Device generated that traffic. To nip threats in the bud, you can use Shield to protect your Network by blocking certain types of traffic. When you configure specific threat categories or threat priorities of traffic types to block, Shield will drop the packets of traffic matching those of the blocked categories\/priorities and provide statistics on those blocked events. We recommend blocking Priority Critical (Level 1) traffic which identifies traffic generated due to malware, trojans, worms, and certain intrusion activity. IDS\/IPS capability is especially useful when CloudConnexa provides an egress route for all internet traffic."},

You can choose to simply monitor the number of domain name resolutions that fall into these content categories, or you can take security a step further and enable blocking. DNS-based filtering lets you block domain name resolutions for those websites that fall into undesirable or unsafe categories. Specific domain names can be added to allow and block lists. Cyber Shield provides data reporting on the number of observed and blocked domain name queries originating from your Users. You can drill down and investigate exactly which User-Devices generated the DNS requests that were flagged with a particular content category. CSV report with the details of the observed\/blocked domain names can be received via email."},

When traffic filtering monitoring is turned ON, Shield will act as an IDS and will monitor the traffic flowing through CloudConnexa in order to provide you with detailed statistics on traffic it has identified as malware, intrusion activity, denial of service, and other types of threats. Once presented with statistics on the type of traffic detected and the number of times that type of traffic was detected, you can drill down and investigate exactly which User-Device generated that traffic. To nip threats in the bud, you can use Shield to protect your Network by blocking certain types of traffic. When you configure specific threat categories or threat priorities of traffic types to block, Shield will drop the packets of traffic matching those of the blocked categories\/priorities and provide statistics on those blocked events. We recommend blocking Priority Critical (Level 1) traffic which identifies traffic generated due to malware, trojans, worms, and certain intrusion activity. IDS\/IPS capability is especially useful when CloudConnexa provides an egress route for all internet traffic."},

DNS-based filtering lets you block domain name resolutions for those websites that fall into undesirable or unsafe categories. Specific domain names can be added to allow and block lists. Cyber Shield provides data reporting on the number of observed and blocked domain name queries originating from your Users.

Once presented with statistics on the type of traffic detected and the number of times that type of traffic was detected, you can drill down and investigate exactly which User’s Device generated that traffic. To nip threats in the bud, you can use Shield to protect your Network by blocking certain types of traffic. When you configure specific threat categories or threat priorities of traffic types to block, Shield will drop the packets of traffic matching those of the blocked categories\/priorities and provide statistics on those blocked events. We recommend blocking Priority Critical (Level 1) traffic which identifies traffic generated due to malware, trojans, worms, and certain intrusion activity. IDS\/IPS capability is especially useful when CloudConnexa provides an egress route for all internet traffic."},

Once presented with statistics on the type of traffic detected and the number of times that type of traffic was detected, you can drill down and investigate exactly which User’s Device generated that traffic. To nip threats in the bud, you can use Shield to protect your Network by blocking certain types of traffic. When you configure specific threat categories or threat priorities of traffic types to block, Shield will drop the packets of traffic matching those of the blocked categories\/priorities and provide statistics on those blocked events. We recommend blocking Priority Critical (Level 1) traffic which identifies traffic generated due to malware, trojans, worms, and certain intrusion activity.

DNS-based filtering lets you block domain name resolutions for those websites that fall into undesirable or unsafe categories. Specific domain names can be added to allow and block lists. Cyber Shield provides data reporting on the number of observed and blocked domain name queries originating from your Users.

Once presented with statistics on the type of traffic detected and the number of times that type of traffic was detected, you can drill down and investigate exactly which User-Device generated that traffic. To nip threats in the bud, you can use Shield to protect your Network by blocking certain types of traffic. When you configure specific threat categories or threat priorities of traffic types to block, Shield will drop the packets of traffic matching those of the blocked categories\/priorities and provide statistics on those blocked events. We recommend blocking Priority Critical (Level 1) traffic which identifies traffic generated due to malware, trojans, worms, and certain intrusion activity. IDS\/IPS capability is especially useful when CloudConnexa provides an egress route for all internet traffic."},
